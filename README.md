# DS Practicum 1

This assignment involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and creating visualizations to uncover insights from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics dataset on Airline/Carrier On-Time Performance for flights originating in Arizona (AZ), Nevada (NV), and California (CA) during 2019. The goal is to analyze flight delays, air traffic patterns, and airline performance in these regions. Key tasks include data preprocessing (converting data types, handling missing/invalid values), generating summary statistics, and developing visualizations to support insights. The Python technical features utilized include the Pandas library for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and NumPy for numerical computations. Custom functions are employed for reusable analysis, such as calculating regional flight proportions and determining the best-performing airlines based on total flight hours. The project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and storytelling through data-driven visualizations, ensuring all outputs are reproducible and easy to interpret.
